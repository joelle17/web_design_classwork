	<h1> Special Characters </h1>
	<p>
	Since &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have a special meaning in HTML, you can't use these characters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called "special characters" to represent them. For example, to have a less than sign appear in your document, you need to use &lt; to represent it.
